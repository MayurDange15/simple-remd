If you make a mistake, there's backups of input and output for each stage in the archive subdirectory for each stage. This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with basic GROMACS and UNIX usage, including using `cd` to move up and down through the directory hierarchy, `cp` to copy files, and `ls` to see what you have in the current directory. This tutorial is intended for use with any GROMACS version since 2016. You may see minor differences if you use other versions of GROMACS."

    "## Theory of replica exchange simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many molecular simulation scenarios require ergodic sampling of energy landscapes that feature many minima, and barriers between minima that can be difficult to cross at ambient temperatures over accessible simulation time scales. This means that results are confounded by the choice of initial conditions, because these determine the region of space that is explored by the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replica exchange simulations seek to enhance the sampling in such scenarios by running numerous independent replicas in slightly different ensembles, and periodically exchanging the coordinates of replicas between the ensembles. Typically, the set of replicas is constructed so that one extreme of the set of replicas is the ensemble from which sampling is wanted, and the other extreme is one where barriers can be crossed more easily. So, if\n",
    "\n",
    "* the attempts to exchange replicas between ensemble produce valid ensembles,\n",
    "* the probability of exchange attempts succeeding is high enough, and\n",
    "* the resulting flow of replicas over the ensembles produces good mixing,\n",
    "\n",
    "then the resulting sampling will be statistically correct and closer to the ergodic ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can this work? It relies on doing Monte Carlo moves of replicas between ensembles. The probability of observing a replica in a particular state depends on the potential energy and the temperature, i.e. $P(x) \\propto \\exp{-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}}$. The range of probabilities that are observed follow a normal distribution (because of the Central Limit Theorem). If two ensembles are chosen so that their distribution of states have significant overlap, then when we observe a state in one there is appreciable chance that it could have been observed in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Potential energy distributions of alanine dipeptide replicas.](images/combined-pot.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to construct a Metropolis-style Monte Carlo move that proposes that we exchange the coordinates found in two replicas based upon the probabilities that they would have been observed in the two ensembles. The exchange is accepted only if a random number has a suitable value. When done correctly, detailed balance is achieved, and the sampling in both ensembles is correct whether or not an exchange took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "What range of ensembles should be chosen? The method of REMD (also known as parallel tempering) conducts the same simulation over a range of temperatures. The highest temperature is chosen so that the barriers will be crossed. Replicas wander up and down through temperature space as exchanges are accepted. Barriers are crossed probabilistically at all of the temperatures, but at a higher rate at the higher temperatures. Those states filter down to the lower temperatures if they \"belong\" to the corresponding ensembles. In this way, the ergodicity of the sampling is enhanced.\n",

    "\n",
    "Temperatures should often be distributed across the replicas in a geometric progression, i.e. with the same ratio used to scale each temperature from the one below it. If the energy landscapes are sufficiently similar across the temperature space, then this will keep the overlap of the potential energy distributions constant. In turn, this will keep the probability of accepting exchanges constant. Beware, though - in real simulations you will find bottle-necks in temperature space that restrict replica flow. You should be prepared to revise your temperature scheme after some testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can read in the above literature, an exchange acceptance probability around 0.2 is generally a good idea. Often you will have to experiment with the number of replicas you need to use to span the desired temperature range to achieve about that exchange probability. If you are simulating in the NPT ensemble, you might try this [REMD temperature generator](http://folding.bmc.uu.se/remd-temperature-generator/) to help out.\n",

    "Normally, mdrun runs a single simulation. For temperature REMD we need to run a number of simulations that can communicate.

Naturally, we will have to equilibrate those to their target temperature before starting replica exchange, and that is most convenient to do with `mdrun -multidir`!\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two ways of thinking about the trajectories in REMD, and so two ways the programmer could implement it. At exchange attempts the replica simulations could exchange coordinates, or they could exchange temperatures. Other MD packages tend to exchange temperatures; GROMACS exchanges coordinates. This means that the trajectory written to a single file belongs to the ensemble described by the matching `.tpr` file. Often this is convenient, because you only want to look at the ensemble at your lowest temperature. Because of the exchanges, that trajectory will no longer be continuous - some totally different structure will appear every time an exchange happened. This will mean the time evolution of observables like RMS deviation over time from some other structure will show abrupt jumps.\n",

    "There are some times you want a trajectory that has continuous coordinates, despite the \"jumps\" in ensemble space. This means chopping up each trajectory file into pieces and pasting them back together in the right order. The Perl script `demux.pl` installed with GROMACS will analyse a single REMD `.log` file and writes two special `.xvg` files that describe the transformation matrices for the trajectory time series from one form to the other, and back. `trjcat -demux` can use these files to do the cut-and-paste on the trajectory files for you."
